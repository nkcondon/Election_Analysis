## Election-Audit Summary: 
This script quickly identifies the each candidate's vote count, county vote counts and the winner. It would be important to identify the number of people eligible to vote to assess voter turnout.  The percentages could be misleading based on the county population. Another modification could be the candidates political affiliation (republican, democrat or independent) or age group of voters.
